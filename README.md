## DLOpy
Efficient Python implementation of [Discontinuity Layout Optimisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuity_layout_optimization) (DLO) for understanding and developing the Python ecosystem in the context of [Linear Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) (LP) problems cast for engineering analysis, in particular geotechnical failure mechanisms.

This repository is intended solely for research/study purposes to further enable the discovery and demonstration of engineering problems and numerical methods cross-discipline with Python. For commercial practice please see [LimitState:GEO](https://www.limitstate.com/geo).

The repository also gives ideas and examples of implementing Numba (compiled generalized universal functions for NumPy arrays), SciPy (linear programming) and Sklearn (graph computing) for efficient numerical computation.

### Development & Use 
Clone the repository ensuring the dependencies in the requirements file are satisfied in the active Python environment, then start by running the files in the tests and examples folders.

Alternatively, to install in an active Python environment and run as demonstrated in the examples files, in the command line: 

    pip install git+https://github.com/dlincoln/dlopy
