# dlopy
Efficient Python implementation (Scipy/Numba) of [Discontinuity Layout Optimisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuity_layout_optimization) (DLO) for testing the Python ecosystem with Linear Programming problems cast for assessing geotechnical failure mechanisms.

This repository is intended solely for research purposes and accessible demonstration/discovery with Python to develop the awareness of engineering problems and numerical methods cross-industry. For commercial use please see [LimitState:GEO](https://www.limitstate.com/geo).
